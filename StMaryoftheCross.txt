Hymn to St Mary of the Cross

%O Mary! first in all our land
%To be so honoured with the name
%Of Saint, for service to the poor
%With joyful love and heart aflame.

O Mother Mary of the Cross
The first Australian saint, we hail.
By thy example may we learn
the Love of God will never fail.

%to love the trials and so prevail.
%that Charity will never fail.
%to serve the God who shall prevail.
%To serve the King who shall prevail.
%The first saint of Australia\\
%Do bless this dry and dusty land\\*
%And make us strong and holier.

% Of all our land of saints the first
% Look down upon our wasted land
% And send down dew to still its thirst

% Our teacher, guide and patroness
% Accept our praise with gloria???


% To Joseph's aid thou ever turned,
Thou ever soughtest Joseph's aid,
Strong in the faith that he would be
An advocate to that dear Heart
That bled and died upon the Tree.

%That Tree that bore our Saviour dear
%He gives us as a burden light
%To which thy name and life were bound
%So through the Cross to glory bright.

The Tree of life, the Cross of death
To which thy name and life were bound,
The paradox that pain and strife
To everlasting joy redound.

O Mary! intercede for us
%And guide our steps, that this our land
%May be God's own from sea to sea
%And yield full fruit beneath His Hand.
And form us to His holy Will
With Father and the Holy Ghost
And Heart of Jesus burning still.
